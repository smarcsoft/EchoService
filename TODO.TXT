1. Continous integration
Setup a continous build process on the build server - DONE
Check that a code commit leads to a new build and container - DONE
If a new image can be successfully build, push it to docker hub, and deploy it in the swarm cluster automatically - DONE

2. Replace docker swarm with kubernetes

3. Perform an update of the service in Kubernetes

4. Add a maximizecpu function
Take a number of seconds as a argument. The function will maximize the cpu for the number of seconds specified.
Check if this is working using Azure Monitor.
Then use the autoscaling capability of kubernetes to create a new pod if cpu > 80%.
