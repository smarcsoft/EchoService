1. Continous integration
Setup a continous build process on the build server
Check that a code commit leads to a new build and container
If a new image can be successfully build, push it to docker hub, and deploy it in the swarm cluster automatically

2. Consolidated logs
Use fluentd to centralize the logging system

3. Replace docker swarm with kubernetes
